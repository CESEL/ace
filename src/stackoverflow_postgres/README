#You'll need 7z to unzip the files:
## sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
# then move the posts file to its own dir and run
## 7z e stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z

# createdb db_name
## put the name of the db into the config file

# create the table
## psql db_name -f create_post.sql

# cat so.xml | ./stackoverflow_postgres.pl config

# You can then strip out the html garbage using Sham's Phpspcldata-normal.php
## The db values etc are hardcoded in the script

#so_xml.pl was a failed attempt
