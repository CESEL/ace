==Uses the docs as an index, postprocessing==

As the number of posts increases the frequency of erroneous and program specific code elements get included in the CE index. This parser keeps only those that are in the docs.

# Run Mark's API doc extractor to get the list of valid code elements
# Make sure there are indexes on clt, you can run ../create_index.sql
# run docs_clt.sql
