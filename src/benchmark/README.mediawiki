==Steps==
# Run benchmark.sql (add an essential and valid columns to the output file)
# Validate code elements and record fp and fn
## Would it break the parser? Record it in record in ../limits.mediawiki 
# Read over whole post
# Describe in a sentence which CEs are essential and how they are being used
# Based on sentence classify CEs as essential

Notes
*If a CE is private (e.g., a method created by the poster) and it is not fully defined in that post, we ignore it because there's no way of knowing its declaring type
*a property is not a code element 
*variables and local fields are excluded
*a variable that is unresolved is equivalent to an undef

Codes for column valid (must end in fp or fn) -- all left blank are considered tp or if pqn is undefined, then tn
*ufn -> undefined but valid, but impossible to get class name (used to be uv)
*vfn -> variable listed, but trust = 1
*sfn -> spelling or capitalization issue
*sfp -> stacktrace false positive
*1fn -> not in ce dict
*bfp -> bad word like add, query, etc
*xfp -> included from XML, but said we're excluding xml?
*gfn -> generic caused a false negative
*lfp -> another language
*ignore -> private code element that doesn't have full definition in post
